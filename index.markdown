Postdoctoral research associate at the University of Bonn, working in [Giles Gardam](https://www.gilesgardam.com/)'s team.

I completed my DPhil at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of [Martin Bridson](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/bridson/). Before that, I obtained my master's degree at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of [Zlil Sela](http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~zlil/). 

[comment]: #I am a Clarendon Scholar and the recipient of the John Moussouris scholarship in mathematics (through Merton College).\

My research is in **geometric group theory** and my work explores connections between geometry, topology and profinite rigidity. I also work with group rings of infinite groups, with a focus on the Kaplansly conjectures.\
In addition, I am interested in model theory and the first-order theory of groups.

### **Teaching:**
- In Winter Semester 2024-2025 I gave a lecture course titled "Groups, Geometry and Logic" (Module V5D4 - Selected Topics in Geometry). The course revolved mostly around the first-order theory of non-abelian free groups. [Lecture notes](/notes.pdf) are available.

- In 2022-2023 I was a Stipendiary Lecturer in Pure Mathematics at Exeter College (University of Oxford), teaching A2: Metric Spaces and Complex Analysis in Michaelmas '22-23 and A4: Integration in Hilary '23. 

- Before that I was a tutor and a TA at the University of Oxford, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Reichman University (IDC Herzliya). I taught linear algebra, discrete mathematics, general topology, set theory, mathematical logic, infinite groups, geometry of surfaces, group theory and integration.

### **Other things that I like:**
I really enjoy it when mathematics and visual arts come together.

In '20-21 I volunteered with [Multaka](https://www.torch.ox.ac.uk/multaka-oxford) and co-produced the __*Precious and Rare: Islamic Metalwork from The Courtauld* exhibition at the History of Science in Oxford__. \
I made a short [animated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zgMIAfFEo) explaining symmetry for the exhibition, and you can see me talking about the exhibition [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYVnhWB8yEQ). I also made a computer programme which allowed exhibition visitors to generate their own symmetric patterns inspired by Islamic art (feel free to email me if you made a cool design and want to share):

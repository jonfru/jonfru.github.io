motivation and main theorem
>**Theorem:** bla bla

test case - branched surfaces - add table for the picture

start with ``triple branched surface'' - three surfaces, each with $b$ boundary components, glued together like in the picture. 

>**Example** $b=2$, we choose $\mathbb{Z}/2 \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z} / 3\mathbb{Z}$. we do bla bla bla


Then start with Wilton - metnion Wilton and Calegari - and say that there are surfaces immersing etc which allow us to build a precover (space that can be completed to a finite-sheeted cover) that does what we want.
>**Theorem:** [Wilton]...

then philosophy about Wilton - not free means... Then say not a free product of free and surface groups - manifests in one of two ways

1) there are 3 things glued together - add a picture. In this case, up to some acrobatics with finite covers etc, it's easy to get the result (add picture again).
2) there is a rigid vertex.

If we are in case 2 (and not case 1), things are trickier. For this we embed two different surfaces within a rigid vertex, and use them to mimic branching. We call such a piece ``artificial branching''. -- Here should probably say something about Wilton's rigid theorem...

Suppose that the two surfaces were embedded - intersecting only at the boundaries. Then we are exactly at the previous case. In general, this gives us an obvious map from a branched surface to our group - replace the rigid vertex with $S_1 \sqcup S_2$. A key observation here is that in order to obtain an injective map on the torsion part of the abelianization, all that we need is that if $b_1,\ldots,b_k$ are the boundaries shared between the surfaces, then $[b_1],\ldots,[b_k]$ generate a rank-$k$ direct summand in the abelianization of $H$ (the rigid vertex).

To obtain that we use a minimality argument, which crucially relies on Calegari's proof that *stable commutator length* is rational in free groups. The precise form of the theorem that we use is the following:
>**Theorem:** [Calegari]...

Then give a short explanation of minimality.

Seal the deal by saying that we can now use an artificial branching piece as in the branched surface case
